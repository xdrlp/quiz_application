// This functions folder was previously used to host a Postmark-based
// sendVerificationEmail callable. You chose to use Firebase's built-in
// email verification instead, so the function is no longer needed.

// File intentionally left as a placeholder. Delete the `functions/`
// directory manually if you want it removed from the repository history.
